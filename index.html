    <h2>About me: </h2>
    <p>I live in Egypt, specifically in Port Said. I have been learning programming for a while, and my goal is to
        become a skilled and successful programmer. The idea of programming came to me when I was working in a job that
        I didn’t really like, and I felt that learning programming could improve my life. Over time, I started learning
        it and discovered that I truly enjoy it. I’ve always loved computers, and I can spend hours working on them
        without even noticing the time. </p>If you want to another Information about me go to this page.<a
