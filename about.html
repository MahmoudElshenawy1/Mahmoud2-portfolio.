<h1>About me.</h1>
<p>
  I live in Egypt, specifically in Port Said. I have been learning programming for a while, and my goal is to
  become a skilled and successful programmer. The idea of programming came to me when I was working in a job that
  I didn’t really like, and I felt that learning programming could improve my life. Over time, I started learning
  it and discovered that I truly enjoy it. I’ve always loved computers, and I can spend hours working on them
  without even noticing the time.
